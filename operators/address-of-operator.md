# Address-of operator

## Introduction

An address-of operator is a mechanism within C++ that returns the memory address of a variable. These addresses returned by the address-of operator are known as pointers, because they "point" to the variable in memory.

The address-of operator is a unary operator represented by an ampersand (&). It is also known as an address operator.
