# Compiling C++

## 1. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

### Brief History

The original _GNU C Compiler_ (GCC) is developed by Richard Stallman, the founder of the _GNU Project_. Richard Stallman founded the GNU project in 1984 to create a complete Unix-like operating system as free software, to promote freedom and cooperation among computer users and programmers.

GCC, formerly for "_GNU C Compiler_", has grown over times to support many languages such as C (`gcc`), C++ (`g++`), Objective-C, Objective-C++, Java (`gcj`), Fortran (`gfortran`), Ada (`gnat`), Go (`gccgo`), OpenMP, Cilk Plus, and OpenAcc. It is now referred to as "_GNU Compiler Collection_". The mother site for GCC is [http://gcc.gnu.org/](http://gcc.gnu.org).&#x20;

### GCC Compilation Process

## 2. GNU Make

The "`make`" utility automates the mundane aspects of building executable from source code. "`make`" uses a so-called `makefile`, which contains rules on how to build the executables.

You can issue "`make --help`" to list the command-line options; or "`man make`" to display the man pages.
